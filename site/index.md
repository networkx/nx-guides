This site provides educational materials officially developed and curated by the
NetworkX community.
The goal of the repository is to provide high-quality educational resources
for learning about network analysis and graph theory with NetworkX.
Examples include:
 - Long-form narrative documentation, such as tutorials
 - In-depth examinations of common graph and network algorithms and their
   implementations in NetworkX
 - Demonstrations or domain-specific applications of NetworkX highlighting
   best-practices for network analysis.

## About

The educational materials are in the form of
[markdown-based Jupyter notebooks][myst-nb], so everything is interactive!
You can follow along yourself:
 1. *on binder*, by clicking on the launch button at the top of this page, or the
    rocket icon in the upper-right corner of any of the pages, or
 2. *locally*, by cloning the repository (see the octocat icon above) and
    running `jupyter notebook`.
